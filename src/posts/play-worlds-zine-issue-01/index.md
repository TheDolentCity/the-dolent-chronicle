In the zine you'll find:

- **Worlds with Rules**, an essay evaluating our hobby's evolution.
- **Cruel Coppinger**, a ~20 page Cornish Gothic adventure.
- **The Waggoneers**, a ~10 page playable, western tale.
- **Worlds Apart**, a lighthearted piece on FKR and Storygames.
- **Several quotes** from the community on why we **play worlds**.

## What is the Play Worlds community?

Play Worlds is a small collective of tabletop RPG enthusiasts who have spent time developing a common ethos over the importance of engaging with the imaginary worlds we create.

While our personal tastes and methods vary, our focus on playing games, game creation, and adventure design have proven fruitful. Our zine represents the tip of the iceberg when it comes to these discussions.
