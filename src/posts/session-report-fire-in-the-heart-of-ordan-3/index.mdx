> With the invention of Jotun, twenty foot tall bipedal war mechs, the Frontier has freed itself from the yoke of the fascist One Earth Alliance. But peace was not meant to last.

> Earth was destroyed.

> The bastards that did it call themselves “The Ventiri.” They tried to do the same to Mars, but a brave few souls stopped them and destroyed their dreadnought. Despite the victory, our losses were significant.

> Now the Ventiri have regrouped and invaded Ordan, a metropolis world and headquarters of Dretyl Armory. The Frontier Militia is sending all nearby forces to engage.

The campaign uses a new tactical ruleset I made and host online. It's basically Lancer but solving all of my personal mechanical gripes with it. I will update the rules over the course of the campaign and then release them for free online.

There are six player characters:

- **DEADEYE**, a sniper jotun. Piloted by **"BULL"**.
- **OBELISK CORVID**, a shield generating jotun. Piloted by **"ECHO"**.
- **SOLAR WOLF**, a CQB jotun in a man-sized frame. Piloted by **"DIZZY"**.
- **MARA**, a sword-wielding jotun with active camo. Piloted by **"GLASS"**.
- **DEDP 709**, a jotun with an experimental drone platform. Piloted by **Finè**.
- **WHALE**, a massive jotun with a mini orbital cannon. Piloted by **"STARFISH"**.
