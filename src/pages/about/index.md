While I produce games under the tagline _The Dolent City_, I think every city needs a good paper. _The Dolent Chronicle_ contains RPG articles, essays, and news. If that interests you, bookmark the site and share links with friends.

If you have an RSS reader and want to get updates for new posts, you can find the relevant file here: [RSS.xml](/rss.xml).

_I will also credit [Slate Blog](https://github.com/SlateDesign/slate-blog) for providing some inspiration and guidance for both layout and features._
