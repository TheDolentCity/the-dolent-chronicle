The campaign uses a new tactical ruleset I made and host online. It's basically Lancer but solving all of my personal mechanical gripes with it. I will update the rules over the course of the campaign and then release them for free online.

There are six player characters:

- **DEADEYE**, a sniper jotun. Piloted by **"BULL"**.
- **OBELISK CORVID**, a shield generating jotun. Piloted by **"ECHO"**.
- **SOLAR WOLF**, a CQB jotun in a man-sized frame. Piloted by **"DIZZY"**.
- **MARA**, a sword-wielding jotun with active camo. Piloted by **"GLASS"**.
- **DEDP 709**, a jotun with an experimental drone platform. Piloted by **Finè**.
- **WHALE**, a massive jotun with a mini orbital cannon. Piloted by **"STARFISH"**.

The session began with the players analyzing data collected by the Ventiri forces in the first mission. They concluded that the Ventiri were seeking something from the museum the PCs had received a distress message from. They boarded a bullet train straight there.

### Summary

The players arrived at the museum plaza to find another pilot, **"ECHO"** surrounded by Ventiri forces. They rushed to assist, clearing out the assault and "destroyer" trolls. "DIZZY" confronted goblin forces in the museum itself, discovering a critically injured goblin staring at "Untitled (Yellow and Blue)" by Mark Rothko. Later in the battle, two powerful flame units called "Scorches" entered the field and wreaked havoc on the group. We ended the session with a distorted radio call from Sgt. Bo indicating that all Ventiri forces are heading to the PC's location and he was coming to pick them up and that they need to protect the nearby landing pad.

### Player Actions

- **"BULL"** destroyed several assault trolls with his plasma cannon and took extensive damage from the Scorch unit.
- **"ECHO"** struggled while under a huge barrage of attacks, but effectively shielded herself and allies from multiple attacks.
- **"DIZZY"** eliminated goblins within the museum and discovered a keycard. Its purpose will become clear next session.
- **"GLASS"** dealt the most damage to the destroyers with her massive arc sword. Although, one powerful attack from a destroyer dealt a wound to GLASS's Jotun. 
- **Finè** used several support drones to put out fires on ally mechs and restore them to full health. However, some of these limited drones were destroyed.
- **"STARFISH"** charged a magnetic rail cannon several times. Each fire destroyed at least one mech, and damaged many others in the radius around it.

### Rulings I Would Change

I wouldn't change any rulings in this session, but I did need to clarify the flame rules.

### Rules I Will Change

There were some difficulties with understanding how fire damage and shields worked. Flame was more of a condition rather than an attack, so it wasn't clear if it damaged shields or bypassed them. I am changing the rule so that the weapon performs an attack that interacts normally with shields, but leftover damage triggers the flame condition.

### End Report

That's all for now. Stay tuned for the next session report where my players discover just who has been asking for their help. It should be out sometime in the next two weeks.
